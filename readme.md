# Little Language Lab

## What is this?

This is a library for building [little languages](http://staff.um.edu.mt/afra1/seminar/little-languages.pdf)
with [tagged template strings](http://2ality.com/2016/11/computing-tag-functions.html)
using a [parsing expression grammar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar).

## What does that look like?

```js
import { lang } from "@modernserf/little-language-lab";

const math = lang`
  AddExpr = MulExpr "+" AddExpr ${(l, _, r) => l + r}
          | MulExpr "-" AddExpr ${(l, _, r) => l - r}
          | MulExpr
  MulExpr = Expr "*" MulExpr ${(l, _, r) => l * r}
          | Expr "/" MulExpr ${(l, _, r) => l / r}
          | Expr
  Expr    = "(" AddExpr ")" ${(_, value) => value}
          | "-" Expr ${(_, value) => -value}
          | number    ${({ value }) => value}
`
math`(-3.5 + 4) * 200` // => 100
```

Another, slightly more complex example:

```js
import { lang } from "@modernserf/little-language-lab";

function interpreter (tokens) {
  const stack = []
  tokens.forEach(t => t(stack))
  return stack[0]
}

const op = (fn) => (stack) => {
  stack.push(fn(stack.pop(), stack.pop()))
}

const rpn = lang`
  Program = Expr * ${interpreter}
  Expr    = Number | Fn
  Number  = number ${({ value }) => (stack) => stack.push(value)}
  Fn      = "+" ${op((r, l) => l + r)}  # note: operands are in reverse order,
          | "-" ${op((r, l) => l - r)}  # because the right operand is popped 
          | "*" ${op((r, l) => l * r)}  # before the left one.
          | "/" ${op((r, l) => l / r)}
`
rpn`-3.5 4 + 200 *` // => 100
```

## Why would I want to do that?

Tagged template strings are a really powerful tool for building domain-specific languages,
but the tools for building languages in javascript tend to be built around the assumption that
your language is being defined at compile time, and few are designed to take advantage
of tagged template strings' interpolation abilities.
